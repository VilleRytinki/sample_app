# Ruby on Rails tutorial sample application

This is the sample application for Ruby on Rails tutorial 7th edition.
This project showcases my ability to develop and test web apps.

The sample application in the tutorial is built with Rails 7 and SQLite3 database and is deployed with Heroku.

However I chose to use:
Framework: Rails 8
Database: Postgresql
Front-End: Bootstrap
CI: Github
Deployment: Render

# Problems I faced and solved
- How to use Bootstrap with Rails 8 as it is different from Rails 7.
- How to use postgresql with Rails 8.
- Using Github as CI platform.
- Using Render as my production pipeline.

I also faced challenges in setting development environment as the book uses Web based text editor that is not available anymore,
so I decided to use VSCode. The problems mainly were about Ruby Language server and getting rubocop(linter) to work.
Development is done on WSL.
